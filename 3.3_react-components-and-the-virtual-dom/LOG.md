### NPM Install Issues
Attempted to run `npm install` but encountered permission issues with npm cache. The following approaches were tried:
1. `npm install` - Failed with EACCES permission error
2. `sudo npm install` - Failed due to terminal requirement for password
3. `npm cache clean --force && npm install --no-cache` - Failed with cache ownership issues
4. `npx --yes npm@latest install` - Failed with similar permission issues

To resolve this, you need to:

1. Fix npm cache permissions by running:
```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:$(id -gn) ~/.npm
```

2. Then run:
```bash
npm install
```

This will properly install all dependencies listed in package.json:
- react
- react-dom
- @babel/core
- @babel/preset-env
- @babel/preset-react
- babel-loader
- webpack
- webpack-cli
- webpack-dev-server
- html-webpack-plugin

After fixing permissions and installing dependencies, you can start the development server with:
```bash
npm start
```
